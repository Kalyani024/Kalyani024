## About Me
ðŸ”¬ I am a Biochemistry and Molecular Biology graduate with a strong interest in **computational biology** and **nanotechnology**. My academic journey and project experiences have equipped me with solid skills in molecular dynamics simulations, drug delivery systems, and bioinformatics. Iâ€™m driven by the potential of computational approaches to tackle complex biological questions and by the promise of nanotechnology in advancing targeted therapies and efficient drug delivery.

### Skills & Interests
- **Computational Biology**: Experienced in molecular dynamics simulations using tools like GROMACS and CHARMM-GUI, and skilled in bioinformatics databases (NCBI, EMBL, GenBank).
- **Nanotechnology Applications**: Completed a project on drug encapsulation in biocompatible polymers (PLGA-PEG-PLGA), exploring efficient drug delivery systems and assessing binding affinities and stabilityâ€”a foundation that has heightened my interest in nanomedicine for cancer therapy.
- **Laboratory Techniques**: Proficient in HPLC, LC-MS, gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting, with practical experience in quality control and assurance from an internship at DNA Labs.

### Career Goals
ðŸš€ I am keen to advance in biotech and pharmaceutical R&D, focusing on computational and nanotechnology-driven solutions for drug development and cancer research. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research in molecular genetics and therapeutic innovation, particularly in projects involving nanomedicine and novel drug delivery systems.
